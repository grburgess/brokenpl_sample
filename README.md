# brokenpl_sample
Rejection sampling of power laws quiet frankly sucks. They are quite common throughout astrophysics. Thankfully, inverse transform sampling allows for a quite speedy work around. However, there is no direct inverse transform for a broken power law. Instead, I show herein how to sample from two power laws that are step-wise continuous via a weighted Bernoulli sampling combined with inverse transform sampling.
